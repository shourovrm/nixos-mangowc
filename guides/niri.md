## Secret service (keyring)

`gnome-keyring-daemon` runs as a small background daemon (~3 MB RAM) — not gnome-shell.
It is auto-unlocked at GDM login via PAM (`modules/nixos/desktop.nix`).

Most apps using `libsecret` work automatically. Chromium-based and Electron apps need flags:

| App | How it's handled |
| --- | --- |
| VS Code | `--password-store=gnome-libsecret` in its override in `packages.nix` |
| Chromium / Chrome | `~/.config/chromium-flags.conf` written by Home Manager in `niri.nix` |
| Other Electron apps | Add a `.config/<appname>-flags.conf` with the two lines below |

```
--ozone-platform=wayland
--password-store=gnome-libsecret
```
